# AgeInMinutesAldenVersion
Age in Minutes project
This is the Age in Minutes project from "The Complete Android 10 and Kotlin Masterclass" 

Since the course was uploaded a big change was implemented in calling a Button and TextView as you are no longer able to call refer to them in the in the .kt file from the .xml file automatically
I followed the directions here: https://www.tutorialkart.com/kotlin-android/set-onclicklistener-button-kotlin-android/ to help implement the button
I then followed the directions here: https://www.tutorialkart.com/kotlin-android/android-textview/ to refer back to the TextView specifically this line:
var helloTextView = findViewById<TextView>(R.id.text_view_id)

Also changed UI color scheme from tutorial to make it more A E S T H E T I C

Thanks for checking it out!
